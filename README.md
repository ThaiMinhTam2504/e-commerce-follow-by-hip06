```
root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/          # React frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/          # Express backend

üß™ How to Run This Project Locally
You need to run both the frontend and the backend in separate terminals.

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ThaiMinhTam2504/e-commerce-follow-by-hip06.git
cd e-commerce-follow-by-hip06
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
By default, GitHub may show the master branch, but all the complete code is in the main branch.
Make sure to switch to the main branch after cloning:
```
git checkout main
```

2. Install Dependencies
For client:
```
cd client
npm install
```
For server:
```
cd ../server
npm install
```
3. Set up Environment Variables

Create two .env files manually (they are not included in the repository).

In client/.env:
REACT_APP_API_URI=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_LIMIT=8
REACT_APP_MCETINY=your_mce_api_key_here

In server/.env:
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/any_name_you_want_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
EMAIL_NAME=youremail@example.com

LIMIT_PRODUCTS=8
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

Replace all the placeholder values with your actual config (especially secrets, API keys, etc.)

cd client
npm start

In another terminal (for server):
cd server
npx nodemon server
